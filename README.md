# CTF Writeups📝
This is a collection of writeups for the CTF practices/competitions I've participated in. As this is an ongoing thing so updates are to be expected.

## Pip modules
All pip modules (if used) will be in `requirements.txt`. To install them do:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
